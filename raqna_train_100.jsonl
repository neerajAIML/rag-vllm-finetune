{"text": "### Human: Optix Question. Is there a way to connect Optix to a SLC5/04 PLC outside of utilizing FTLinx Gateway as the RA Ethernet/IP driver does not have the support. ### Assistant: SLC 5/03  5/04  5/05 each have two physical communications ports on the front.  Port 1 is RS232 and can be configured as DF1, DH-485, or ASCII.  Port 0 is DH-485, DH+, or Ethernet for SLC 5/03,  5/04,  5/05, respectively.\n You asked about using the RA EtherNet/IP driver with the SLC 5/04 which has a RS232 port and a DH+ port... neither is CIP enabled thus not directly compatible with the RA EtherNet/IP driver.   A communications gateway could be used to convert the protocol from RA EtherNet/IP to DH-485, DF1, or DH+.  I don't know if a gateway exit that can convert RA EtherNet/IP to another protocol.  FT Optix RA EtherNet/IP - Logix Staton is only for native Logix5000 tag data.  Besides the traditional hardware gateway, you could use a software gateway or even OPC UA server such as FTLinx Gateway.\n Besides the RA EtherNet/IP driver, there is a MIcroControllerDriver pictured below via FT Optix v1.3.0.280 (beta).  Notice it supports Micro800, MicroLogix1400, PLC  and SLC via FTOptic runtime on a PC.  For the picture below, I am running FT Optix via the FT Hub where FT Optix Design Studio is running in the cloud and I am only using a web browser on my PC.

I have to perform a conversion from E-Designer (Beijer) to FT View, it exist any tool that help with this conversion or is necessary do it from the beginning in FT View? ### Assistant: When recreating the application in FT View Studio, I find it helpful to take a screen capture of each screen in the original HMI screen  and inserting it into FT View GFX as "wallpaper".  The wallpaper is a BMP file that is locked in the GFX so that you can draw your new object over top of the old object thus using the wallpaper to get the size, position, color, font and etc. to exactly match the previous HMI.  For example, when drawing a new push button, you position the new button using the wall paper to get it located at the exact same pixel location as the button on the original HMI.

Rather than using a static message, insert a String variable where the String value comes from a String tag in a controller.  You can create logic in the controller to scroll your message through the String tag in the controller.  The HMI will display the value that it gets from the controller.  If the HMI display is updating at once a second, then the scrolling would be rather slow as you would not want the logic to shift the characters faster than the HMI can read them.   2. Rather than using the controller to shift the characters, you could write some VBA to shift the characters in the String variable with the VBA running on the HMI screen.  3.

FTView SE needs host id name resolution.  Usually there is a DNS server, otherwise you can use host files on each PC. I suggest to install the same patches on all computers of your network; although you're not encountering issues on other clients, I've found this to be a good practice to avoid problems when trying to connect the client to the server.

I have a signal list and I am putting Jumper across XIC to active OTE in online program edits and seeing responses on SCADA. Putting jumper across XIC ( not IOs to force) taking me too much time to test the program  online. Is there any easy way to Force each tags. Tags are not from IOs. Many of them are Internal and Soft signals derived from programs or Bacnet or modbus. ### Assistant: Most SCADA systems will read the PLC data even when it is in Program mode. You could go to Program mode and toggle the bits in ladder using CTRL+T, or set them form the data table. Maybe you can disable your Bacnet or Modbus communications so that the data is not being updated over the network, then change the bits as described above. Only I/O tags can be forced. You could do a cross-reference to find the place where the XIC is set, and keep going back until you find the origin of the tag, and force that. The logic scan is where the XIC OTE (and other instructions are evaluated).  The Prog/Run keyswitch can be used globally for all logic in the controller.  Or you can be more granular and inhibit a program, task, routine, or rung.  Once the logic is inhibited, you can modify the tags directly w/o fighting with the logical scan where the logic would overwrite your data. The IO scan is used to update the IO-defined tags.  If you inhibit an IO module in the IO tree, then you can directly command the tags for that IO module.  If you have several IO modules under one (rack) adapter or bridge module... you can inhibit the rack or bridge module and then you can directly command those module.  If you desire a more granular approach... If you force the IO, you can overwrite an individual the IO tag value.\n"}

How to diagnosis an AENTR Aanalog output module faulty or not? ### Assistant: I would start by going online with the controller and looking at the module in the IO tree.  if there is something wrong, the icon for module will indicate a fault and you can open that module properties to get more details. All the module status that you see in Logix Designer, can be gathered programmatically via GSV and/or MSG instruction  and then displayed for an operator on the HMI e.g. EntryStatus, FaultStatus, etc. Assuming the hardware is fine, then I'd look at the logic.  Specifically, I'd eliminate the logic and just command the outputs directly by their IO-defined tag.  This is what I call an "IO check-out" where I check every channel on every module.  I would have the AO wired to my multimeter where commanding the IO-defined tag would drive the AO and I could verify the value at the AO terminals via my multimeter.  You can bypass the AO logic by doing an online test edit where you eliminate the logic that is writing to the AO channel.  You can "test" the delete and then "untest" delete, thus cancelling the delete.\n"}

When I turn the key on CPU and made program mode, I did not get program mode tag high to HMI.

When the controller is in Program Mode, as shown, the instructions don't run, so the values are as they were when it was last in Run mode. You haven't said what SCADA system you are using. If you are using FactoryTalk View SE then there are some tags you can read to get the status. They begin with @ and you can find a list in the documentation. You could look at the @Mode tag. If you are using a different SCADA package, check its documentation. You could use GSV instructions an ladder to get information about the Controller status. You are using a redundant processor, so you ought to be able to get information about each controller from the Redundancy object.

{"text": "### Human: Does a Stratix 8000 GB Port Trunk line provide management without setup? I have a machine network that has been having very intermittent issues.  The original configuration was 4 Stratix 8000 switches set up in a ring configuration (not to be confused with DLR it is not set up that way) with the trunk line connecting to the giga ports.  Each of these switches branched off to various phoenix contact unmanaged switches via their fast ethernet ports and then to all the devices on the machine network.  Although the ring remains, 3 of the 4 stratix switches were changed out for unmanaged phoenix contact switches.  This network has been this way for a while now.  I was told by one of the responsibles for this machine they didn't believe any of the management functions were being used on the stratix's so that is why they just been replacing them with the phoenix switches on failure.  It doesn't SEEM like it outwardly causes an issue and I went online to the one remaining Stratix switch and couldn't see any of the management features being used. All this being said when I referred to the print of the network layout it referred to this "ring" as a "network managed ring circuit".  So I guess my question is do these Stratix switches provide some level of management through these giga ports without any additional setup?  There must be a reason for this ring configuration to be used. ### Assistant: Stratix managed switches by default (OOB) have spanning tree enabled (protecting against loops). As you mentioned you went online to the switch, I assume an express setup has been performed. This also enables and configures lots of other features in the background like spanning tree protection mechanisms, alarming, QoS, CIP management protocol, HTTP/HTTPS webpage management, IGMP multicast management, ... Spanning tree prevents loops and provides a single path of communication between devices by blocking the alternate port on the ring. When a link fails, the switch detects this and will open the alternate port to restore communication. It is advised to monitor (manage) the network so that when a network failure happens, you are alerted about it and know you need to fix it. When the network is not being monitored, you will not know about it until a second fault occurs and production stops anyway, defeating  the purpose of using a ring topology (it only buys some time). Adding unmanaged switches to a ring can result in unexpected behavior as they do not support any loop prevention protocol, like in this case spanning tree. They will not notify the other switches on what path to open/close when connection faults occur, nor do they provide any status information. There are many reasons why a managed switch could be beneficial, like diagnostics & troubleshooting (it helps you find the reason of the intermittent connections issues, shows status of ports, ...), loop prevention, security, .... Stratix managed switches can also be integrated into Logix controllers to provide additional information. This can also be monitored via faceplates on an HMI running FTView.\n"}

I'm not sure if stored procedures are possible with that, but the other option is ODBC. As for the ability to execute them from Optix, yes it is technically possible. However, there is no specific native object from within Optix Studio to do this. I believe that is on the list for the future. Currently, to do this you would need to add a runtime NetLogic and write your own C# code to interact with the database and do things like stored procedure calls. It could, of course, still be linked up to a button in the UI, but the C# backend is the only option to handle these type of advanced operations.\n"}

I have some HMI screens in FactoryLink and I would like to convert the files to be able to open them from FactoryTalk View. How can I do it ? ### Assistant: Unfortunately, the only method I am aware of is the old fashioned, brute-force method of re-engineering each screen in the new system.   As part of a small team, we replaced a FactoryLink system with PlantPAx and ViewSE about 9 years ago and it was a manual process.  We took the opportunity to modernize the controller applications and get the operational benefits out of PlantPAx by rewriting the entire application.  We used the PlantPAx engineering tools to reduce some of our development time on the controller side but the screen work was all manual.\n"}
{"text": "### Human: Optix - How to replicate Function of a Global Object? I have been playing around with "Alias" in Optix and I think I can make that work for my "Base Objects", but I am curious if there is a better way, maybe something with Variables? My Global objects have global definitions, and I am able to do things like assign a single variable to identify, say, an axis number.  My axis is generally pulling information from multiple places and interacting with control tags in a specific group. Many of these tags have a similar layout but when you add in the ones that are outside of the standard it starts to make configuration annoying. Except they are always Identified by a common number format.  Axis 1 will always have a "1" in the tags used, no matter the formatting of the tag. So, I really just need to be able to assign a variable, much like I do in FTStudio. Where "#1" is assigned a Value of 3 in the global definitions of each instance of the Object. I feel like we need a whole "This FTStudio concept is done this way in FTOptix" video series.  ### Assistant: Aliases are a great way to create reusable content within FactoryTalk Optix, especially when you have a single source like a predefined Optix model object or Logix structure. Another capability which can be useful in the case of a variable structure like your axis example is to use a formatted dynamic link.  This capability allows you to format portions of your tag reference as a variable such as the axis number.  You can then bind the variable to a source to pass in the axis number at runtime.  In the example below, {n} is a variable representing the axis number. There are several ways to pass in the axis variable as a source at runtime such as binding it to a spin box value or list box selected item value used to specify the axis to view.\n"}

This can be interpreted as the encoder connection was not designed/tested nor supported for RIUP.  If the Kinetix is power but the CIP axis is disabled (open loop), I believe it is still reading the encoder position and it would register an encoder fault.\n"}

The Keeper Signature was injected the online Keeper capable devices e.g. 1756-CNB, 1756-CN2, etc.  The Scanner Signature was injected into your online CLX L72 processor.  After successfully scheduling ControlNet, you must immediately upload from the CLX controller to your PC because the online controller has the (injected) Scanner Signature.  If you do not upload after scheduling, then your offline ACD does not have the (injected) Scanner Signature and downing that ACD (without the Scanner key) will break your ControlNet connections.  If you upload after scheduling, then you can download without breaking the scheduled connections.  Once the Scanner Signature is captured in the offline file, you can change anything in that file and you will not break the scheduled ControlNet connections (unless you modify the ControlNet connections e.g. path, RPI, tag size). If you export your ACD file to a L5k or L5x and look at the ControlNet card, you will see the Scanner signature.  This Scanner signature is not visible in the RSLogix5000 software, but it is generated and displayed in RSNetworx.  If you don't upload the CLX after scheduling, then the ACD file on your PC will have the wrong Scanner Signature... By default it will be 16#0000_0000..  The Scanner Signature in the CLX controller (shown below via the L5k export) must match the Scanner Signature that was registered in the Active Keeper.\n"}

{"text": "### Human: View Designer issue. I have a question.  Now I want to convert Panel Builder 32 program to View Designer. I have one issue regarding button settings: "handshake" tag exists in Panel Builder 32 but not in View Designer. Where to assign the "handshake" tag in View Designer? ### Assistant: Newer HMI software, such as View Designer and FT Optix, do not have this handshaking option. Older software, such as Panel Builder 32 and FT View ME, do have this option. I'm pretty confident the reason for this has to do with communications between the HMI and PLC. The older software were designed for systems that used some form of serial or early Ethernet communications. Thus, the connections between the HMI device and the PLC data were somewhat asynchronous or less 'real-time'. I believe to ensure that the changed value actually was written to the PLC, the handshake feature was used to keep the value written from the HMI active until the PLC confirms the change. The newer software were written based on modern hardware and modern communications, which are orders of magnitude faster and more stable. Thus, the connection of data between PLC and HMI is more real-time and feedback is kind of built in to the cyclic communications. The handshake feature doesn't exist anymore because it isn't necessary or valuable. Perhaps I'm totally wrong, but to me it is the most logical conclusion. The button touch on a PV5000 (with View Designer software) writes a new value to the PLC tag immediately and can read that tag value back an instant later to ensure that the data transfer completed. If there is an issue with the connection to the PLC tag, the HMI runtime actually notifies you of the error with a red X and an error dialog. The handshaking is built-in, so to speak. You don't need the handshake anymore. Maybe you have to make some changes in your PLC code to accommodate the new HMI. Every new project I have done with modern PLC and HMI does not use handshaking or separate .Value and .Indicator tags. There is just one tag tied to the writing element of the HMI and this works just fine. To implement the handshaking feature with View Designer would take some creativity and I don't think it is worth the effort. It would be easier to change the PLC code to remove the handshake requirement.\n"}

Is there a way to update the offline project's firmware revision to match the controller's firmware revision? Or is there another solution to resolve this compatibility issue? ### Assistant: If you can't install v34 of Logix Designer then you cannot go online with the controller without wiping the project from the PLC, because you will have to change the firmware which will always wipe out the current project. If you can install v34 of Logix Designer, then the solution is simple, install it, upload the program. You can update the offline project file's firmware revision, but you need to have v34 installed. If you do, then go to controller properties and select "Change Controller" in the General tab. Change only the firmware revision, it will still ask you to upload when you try to connect though, so if you get v34 installed you might as well just upload the current project file from the PLC and ignore your offline file.\n"}

Then depending of your need you can Gear, Cam any of the remote machine to the Virtual slave that is sync to your master axis on the master machine.  If your application is bellow V32, you will have to use a CIP sync AOI (much more complex), at this stage please engage a Rockwell Automation support.\n Option 2: Buy a CIP motion encoder , and install it on the Master Machine, this encoder will be connected on the Network and processor of the remote (slave)Machine. This encoder will be seen as a real CIP Motion axis in the remote Machine, you can them use this axis as a master for the other axis on this remote machine. Them you just have to creat a PCAM , MAG..etc between this encoder and the axis that you need to synchronise on this slave machine.\n The Option 2 is the easiest, but require some investment.

There was an HMI backup and Restore utility under the View Tools that gives you the capability of backing up a running HMI application.  You can also back of the FTD but I believe you have to manually recreate the data shortcuts back in that version.\n"}

{"text": "### Human: Using AOIs in w/FTLogix Echo and Studio 5000 question. I have recently started testing my 5580 PLC logic using FTLogix Echo. I have some AOI logic that was previously developed by the client that gave us the go-by logic. My question is: Are AOIs emulated with FTLogix? What I noticed is that I couldn't get any values that were supposed to be written internally by the AOI logic to work, but if I tied those parameters to external variables and moved those around, THEN the logic would function. Say for example, I had some logic that would look at a 3-state switch and had an internal parameter called 3_switch. If I tried to write to that parameter (AOItest.3_switch) either with logic or by just clicking on the parameter and entering a value, I couldn't change the value. But, if I change the parameter to "required" in the Instruction Definitions and make a new external tag that is assigned to that parameter, the value will change when I change values in the newly created tag (newtag-->AOItest.3_switch). I just need to know if this is something I just need to deal with in testing or do I need to modify the AOIs/logic permanently. ### Assistant: I've been using Echo quite a bit recently.  Where I used to jump immediately to the controller on my desk, I prefer the speed and convenience of testing with Echo. Echo does indeed support add-on instructions.  And you should be able to feed (not required) input values into the add-on tag structure. When you feed data into the instruction through a required input parameter via an external tag as you suggest, that data is copied into the AOI tag structure immediately before executing the add-on logic.  (If it's an in/out parameter, the data isn't copied... the actual external tag is used directly by the addon.) In my experience, things like this tend to explained by something not-so-obvious.  For example: 1. Logic in the enable-in-false routine changes the value, 2. Logic in a separate task changes the value. Or even something as silly as a typo such that the data is fed into a tag structure that is not the same add-on tag as on the instruction faceplate.\n"}

Does anyone know where the DB's are stored in the PC running the runtime ? - I thought it would be project folder related , but it seems thats not the case as i have managed to corrupt a DB once or twice experimenting with SQL queries , and when you open a previously saved / older project, the problem of the DB seems to still exist. Id like to copy it and drop it back into the correct place rather than rebuild from an error. ### Assistant: Assuming we are talking about an embedded database (DataStore), with the DataStore's "In memory" configuration value set to false, Optix will create an .sqlite database file with the DataStore's "Filename" configuration value and place it in the Windows user's AppData directory.  If you don't have a "Filename" configured, Optix will create a file with some guid-looking filename.  Example path shown below, C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Rockwell Automation\FactoryTalk Optix\Emulator\Projects\{project name}\ApplicationFiles\filename.sqlite. I would also recommend doing an internet search for a DB browser for SQLite.  Makes it easy to see the contents of this embedded database.  Just don't have it, or try to open when running Optix.\n"}

I also tried playing around with MessageBox.Show() and passed in my popup through this, but no luck. Is this something that would have to be pieced together with different assemblies and references outside of Optix prebuilt library? Or am I missing something within the documentation that could point me in the right direction? ### Assistant: You should be able to do this using the .OpenDialog() method. In the Template Libraries, you can add the Login form to your project, which will bring in a NetLogic called 'LoginButtonLogic'. If you open it, you'll find a good example of how a popup dialog is called using this method. Hopefully that gives you enough ammunition.\n"}

BUT - the button text should also be a parameter value. How is that done? And how does that then work with different languages?  ### Assistant: I have made a solution where the action of the button is handled by a VBA-routine. Here the text is taken from a "label database" where I have the label in different languages. As this solution is consistent with what I use in iFix and WinCC I chose to do it this way - despite a maybe more elegant FTview solution - where the language would have to be handled anyway.\n"}
{"text": "### Human: PF755 Increment /Decrement Speed using 0-10V. Is it possible to increment the PF755 speed in fixed amount using a 0-10V or -10V to 10V i.e if the drive receives 10V it will increment the speed by 2Hz and if it receives -10V the speed will decrement by 2Hz . I know it is possible using DI assignment but PF755 has only one input and that input is assigned to Run and dont have a seprate I/O card . Also since it is standalone VFD control over ethernet is not possible. We have a spring return Selector Switch which if turned in one Direction speed should increment by 2Hz and if it turned to another it should decrease by 2Hz. Can i connect a analog input to the drive through this such that drive receives +/-10V and accordingly increment/decrement speed by 2Hz ### Assistant: As pointed out on your initial post, the implementation of that application requirement would be possible configuring the MOP  (Motor Operated Potentiometer) feature of the PowerFlex 755 with the help of 2 digital inputs. In the scenario presented, it looks like there are not spare inputs available to be used, so the straight forward implementation of the MOP feature will not be possible. To my knowledge, based on the MOP block diagram below, there is no indication that the  switching of a +/- 10V analogue input will be triggering the 2Hz increase or decrease sought after on this application.\n"}

I am not sure of the complete path of the PV USB port. Has anyone done this? ### Assistant: I have gone a different route where I have setup the scanner to send F1 and have made a Key Assignment to the String Input Enable to open with F1.

{"text": "### Human: I have an application I'll be receiving where we will be using a Kinetix 5700 drive system to control stack crowders for a blank destacking application.  My issue is we don't have good control over the stack location.  I was wondering if there was a way for the Kinetix drive to "find" the stack location and perform its location based off its "learned" location.  I'm envisioning that when the stack is loaded, the crowders would advance with low torque toward the stack.  When the drive senses a jump in current, it would record the location and base its crowding operation off that location.   ### Assistant: What you try to do should be possible, this will require some code in your Logix controller, and can be challenging. You also could use the VTS to do this (virtual Torque Sensor). There is also a very common way to locate the position of an item that is unknown, it's the registration sensor. You can connect to the drive an accurate sensor that will detect the presence of the item, and take a "picture" (registration) of the actual position of your axis. since you know the relative position of your sensor (HW location) and the position of your axis when the item trigger the sensor you know now the position of your item relative to the actual axis location. So you can control move your axis to an accurate position relative to your item. this require some code in Logix aswell.\n"}

If so, how did you accomplish this because we keep getting restriction errors due to the download function requiring to have the project open. ### Assistant: The Logix Designer SDK supports concurrent execution with synchronous interfaces calls. With that, the download operation itself can happen in parallel, however, the user project opening step due to the Logix Designer limitation cannot. So practically, when executing the download procedure in the loop, make sure that the project opening step has ended, and then run the download, even though the one from the previous iteration is still pending.\n"}

From testing and looking through documentation I have not found any way to get the multiversion of Studio 5000 to silently install all included versions.  According to technote QA3363 - RSLogix 5000/ Studio 5000: Silent Installation we might run into some issues doing a silent install on some earlier versions of Studio 5000.

Which are the best options to do that data log? Considering I need to save it each time it changes, it is around 1.5 sec. ### Assistant: FactoryTalk View ME has a few options for logging data. The simplest way is to create a datalog model. A datalog can log data upon each change or upon a set interval and will be stored on your industrial PC. You can also you an ActiveX control like MECSVDatalog, which will log the data directly to an excel spreadsheet. Other more expensive options include purchasing software to log the data from the PLC. I don't know what you need to do with the data, and that will probably effect what you decide, but if all you need is to look at the data or display it on the HMI then a datalog model would do well.\n"}
